# Runify

## What's this?

Runify is a Strava-esque platform with a goal of making many advanced metrics paywalled by Strava more widely available.
It also fixes many of the nice-to-have features that Strava does not (better workout visibility). We also plan to provide tools for coaches to assign workouts and
for runners to mark their workouts as completing coach-defined workouts.

## Current Status
This project is currently in very early development and we are currently trying to create the necessary algorithms and API spec before developing either the backend or the frontend.

To see our progress, check out our [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1otQ1p44epb4aDC_gV2EMzUMwYKy_1-d5wA-t6tC3zEU/view).

## Stack

DB: Postgres

API Server: FastAPI/uvicorn

Web Server: Flask

Note that to ease development (*cough* have a language that everyone knows), we will be writing the backend in Python. This is (obviously) not ideal performance-wise, but should be "good enough" for the scale of this project.

Runify in C coming soom (not really, more like 2029 or something like that)
